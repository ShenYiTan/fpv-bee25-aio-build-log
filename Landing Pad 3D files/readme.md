This folder contains the 3D printable files (STLs) used to create custom landing pads for the SpeedyBee 25.

We used these parts to increase ground clearance and protect the motors/frame after diagnosing the motor burnout issue (see the main build log for details).

## ✨ Credit

The design for the landing pads was sourced from the open-source community.
